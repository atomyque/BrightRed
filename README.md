### [BrightRed]

Bright Red is a satire chat triggers module inspired by the module red addons made to spam chat as much as possible with a bunch of diverse info, some usefull, some plain annoying.
This mod is recommended if you want to get ignored by all of the party finder and could also get muted if you enable everything.
